      <title>Global spread and adaptation of a major crop pathogen</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an ongoing project and is described here only for information. The figures are from talks I have made and they are likely to change as this project evolves and until it gets published officially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human activity has a tremendous impact on the evolutionary trajectories of many species worldwide. Global trade of agricultural goods contributes to the dispersal of domesticated species but also of their pathogens, reshaping species distributions to include new environments and climates. In the agricultural context, humans partially control the evolution of crop species as well as some environmental variables, thus imposing selective pressure on crop pathogens. Understanding how pathogens surmount control strategies and cope with new climates is crucial to predicting the future impact of crop pathogens in a changing world.
&lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria tritici&lt;/em&gt; is a major bread and durum wheat pathogen, and causes significant damage in wheat cultivation. It was previously discovered that the center-of-origin of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt; is the Middle-East, where its sister species are infecting wild grasses. It was also found that the speciation of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt; happened at the same time as the domestication of its host. &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt; is now reported in most wheat-growing regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using more than a thousand isolates of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;, we assembled the largest-to-date number of genomes from a fungal plant pathogen species in order to retrace worldwide invasion routes of this species and ongoing genetic exchange among major wheat-growing regions. We identified eleven genetic clusters (see image below), and an early split between the populations of the Middle-East/Africa and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reconstructing the evolutionary history of the species, we uncovered its impact on adaptive genetic variation and on the evolution of the pathogen genome. Finally, we identify standing variation for adaptation to new climates encountered during the global spread. See below an example of such an analysis for two of the thirteen variables we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, our work demonstrates how a comprehensive panel of genomes enables deep insights into the evolutionary history of a major crop pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genomic and epigenomic architecture of a plant pathogen</title>
      <link>https://afeurtey.github.io/project/genomic_architecture/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 11:45:16 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://afeurtey.github.io/project/genomic_architecture/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-06871-w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Link to the publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antagonistic co-evolution can drive rapid adaptation in pathogens and shape genome architecture. Comparative genome analyses of several fungal pathogens revealed highly variable genomes, for many species characterized by specific repeat-rich genome compartments with exceptionally high sequence variability. Dynamic genome structure may enable fast adaptation to host genetics. The wheat pathogen &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria tritici&lt;/em&gt; with its highly variable genome, has emerged as a model organism to study genome evolution of plant pathogens. Here, we compared genomes of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt; isolates and of sister species infecting wild grasses to address the evolution of genome composition and structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using long-read technology, we sequenced and assembled genomes of &lt;em&gt;Z. ardabiliae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Z. brevis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Z. pseudotritici&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Z. passerinii&lt;/em&gt;, together with two isolates of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;. We report a high extent of genome collinearity among &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria&lt;/em&gt; species and high conservation of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures of compartmentalization (see image below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afeurtey.github.io/images/Genome_compartment_circos.png&#34; alt=&#34;Circos plots from Z.tritici and Z.pseudotritici, showing compartmentalization at the genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic levels&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identify high gene content variability both within and between species. In addition, such variability is mainly limited to the accessory chromosomes and accessory compartments. Despite strong host specificity and non-overlapping host-range between species, predicted effectors are mainly shared among &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria&lt;/em&gt; species, yet exhibiting a high level of presence-absence polymorphism within &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;. Using in planta transcriptomic data from &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;, we suggest different roles for the shared orthologs and for the accessory genes during infection of their hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite previous reports of high genomic plasticity in &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;, we describe here a high level of conservation in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic composition and structure across the genus &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria&lt;/em&gt;. The compartmentalized genome allows the maintenance of a functional core genome co-occurring with a highly variable accessory genome.&lt;/p&gt;
