This system transfers information from one generation to the next imperfectly but while maintaining its core structure and functionality. Taken down to its core elements, biology can thus be conceptualised in an information science framework. Furthermore, biological information is transferred in an organized manner, using common patterns of only four letters to form a complex language. Deciphering this genetic grammar is still one of the biggest challenges in biology today. Some DNA grammar elements exhibit near-universality across the tree of life, such as the codon “ATG” (encoding a methionine) to mark the start signal of a gene in most organisms. However, while such common signals as start/stop codons exist, many evolutionary lineages have adopted specific language elements, contributing to the diversification and adaptation of organisms. Such specificities vary in how evolutionary recent they are and thus how clade-specific they appear. Although coding sequence exhibit such patterns (such as with codon optimization for example), this is particularly true in the non-coding parts of the genome.\nIn the last years, new sequencing technologies have promoted the production of a deluge of new -omics data, allowing for tremendous progress in various fields such as genomics, transcriptomics or epigenomics. However, until recently finding methods to synthesize the information contained within such large amounts of data has been near impossible. I propose to take advantage of the groundbreaking advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to mine the huge amount of available -omics data and provide new insights into old standing biological questions. In particular, I want to apply the latest development in Deep Learning (DL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to investigate the universality and specificities of the genetic language.\nAs a first step toward answering these questions, I tested whether nucleotides can be successfully predicted in fungal genomes with a neural network. I used a simple convolution neural network (CNN), including 25 layers and previously developed to do prediction on Arabidopsis thaliana by Gonzalo et al.. Initial tests showed that the CNN trained on Brassicales genomes was unable to predict fungal sequences, so I trained the model again using 25 genomes of Pezizomycotina species, a clade representing a large part of the fungal diversity but excluding budding yeasts. The model trains following the logic of a masked language model and learns to predict each nucleotide identity based on the sequence context.\n   The original CNN was trained on several Brassicales including on A. thaliana and the predictions were done on the same species (specifically on an unseen chromosome). My goal of using deep learning to learn the DNA language of fungi requires that the knowledge learned on a species ensemble be transferable to other related species. Consequently, I chose to test the model on 9 Pezizomycotina which were never seen during the training of the model. The prediction quality was generally similar between sequences from the seen and unseen species, indicating that the model successfully learned transferable patterns from the initial genomes.\nIn neural networks, embeddings are the learned representations of the processed inputs (here, corresponding to DNA sequences) and they should map similar objects close to each other in the embedding space. If the trained CNN has successfully learned the underlying structure of the DNA sequence as suggested by the comparable results between seen and unseen species, the embedding vectors should reflect the known origin of the sequences (i.e. CDS or non-CDS for example). We analysed the embeddings for 100bp sequences using a dimensionality reduction method (UMAP) and indeed showed that sequences from CDS, intronic sequences and repeats were clustering together.\n   For each position, the model can output probabilities for each possible base (A, T, C, G). Based on these probabilities we can compute a prediction score that correspond to the probability of the correct base divided by the average of the prediction for the three other bases. Represented along a sequence in the genome this score reveals which positions are easy to predict (highly negative). In a random gene example from Zymoseptoria tritici (see panel A of the figure below), we observe that the start and stop codon are predicted correctly with a very high probability. Other easily predicted positions include slicing sites at intron/exon borders. This is confirmed by the values observed across the sequences of 849 genes (panel B).\n   Taken together these results indicate that a simple CNN is able to successfully learn the basics syntax elements of the fungal DNA language. These preliminary results provide hint that even such a simple model could be used to predict genes in newly sequenced non-model species, for example, …","date":1690934400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690934400,"objectID":"1f797c17c4a213f9800631a972415a86","permalink":"https://afeurtey.github.io/project/deep_learning_fungal_dna/","publishdate":"2023-08-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deep_learning_fungal_dna/","section":"project","summary":".","tags":null,"title":"Using deep learning to unveil the language of fungal DNA","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This project has been published in Nature Communications in February 2023 and can be found here. You can find a very short summary of our main findings below.\n Human activity has a tremendous impact on the evolutionary trajectories of many species worldwide. Global trade of agricultural goods contributes to the dispersal of domesticated species but also of their pathogens, reshaping species distributions to include new environments and climates. In the agricultural context, humans partially control the evolution of crop species as well as some environmental variables, thus imposing selective pressure on crop pathogens. Understanding how pathogens surmount control strategies and cope with new climates is crucial to predicting the future impact of crop pathogens in a changing world. Zymoseptoria tritici is a major bread and durum wheat pathogen, and causes significant damage in wheat cultivation. It was previously discovered that the center-of-origin of Z. tritici is the Middle-East, where its sister species are infecting wild grasses. It was also found that the speciation of Z. tritici happened at the same time as the domestication of its host. Z. tritici is now reported in most wheat-growing regions of the world.\nUsing more than a thousand isolates of Z. tritici, we assembled the largest-to-date number of genomes from a fungal plant pathogen species in order to retrace worldwide invasion routes of this species and ongoing genetic exchange among major wheat-growing regions. We identified eleven genetic clusters (see image below), and an early split between the populations of the Middle-East/Africa and the rest of the world.\n   We also show that the out-of-the-Middle-East migration accompanied by increased activity of transposable elements, probably due to weakened genomic defenses against transposable elements.\n   By reconstructing the evolutionary history of the species, we uncovered its impact on adaptive genetic variation and on the evolution of the pathogen genome. Finally, we identify standing variation for adaptation to new climates encountered during the global spread. See below an example of such an analysis for two of the thirteen variables we used.\n   Our work shows how large population genomic panels enable deep insights into the evolutionary trajectory of a major crop pathogen.\n","date":1677628800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1677628800,"objectID":"f2fc37ec3a25261caa0fada46935b231","permalink":"https://afeurtey.github.io/project/thousand_zt_genomes/","publishdate":"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/thousand_zt_genomes/","section":"project","summary":"This project has been published in Nature Communications in February 2023 and can be found here.

Comparative genome analyses of several fungal pathogens revealed highly variable genomes, for many species characterized by specific repeat-rich genome compartments with exceptionally high sequence variability. Dynamic genome structure may enable fast adaptation to host genetics. The wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici with its highly variable genome, has emerged as a model organism to study genome evolution of plant pathogens. Here, we compared genomes of Z. tritici isolates and of sister species infecting wild grasses to address the evolution of genome composition and structure.\nResults Using long-read technology, we sequenced and assembled genomes of Z. ardabiliae, Z. brevis, Z. pseudotritici and Z. passerinii, together with two isolates of Z. tritici. We report a high extent of genome collinearity among Zymoseptoria species and high conservation of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures of compartmentalization (see image below).\n   We identify high gene content variability both within and between species. In addition, such variability is mainly limited to the accessory chromosomes and accessory compartments. Despite strong host specificity and non-overlapping host-range between species, predicted effectors are mainly shared among Zymoseptoria species, yet exhibiting a high level of presence-absence polymorphism within Z. tritici. Using in planta transcriptomic data from Z. tritici, we suggest different roles for the shared orthologs and for the accessory genes during infection of their hosts.\nConclusion Despite previous reports of high genomic plasticity in Z. tritici, we describe here a high level of conservation in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic composition and structure across the genus Zymoseptoria. The compartmentalized genome allows the maintenance of a functional core genome co-occurring with a highly variable accessory genome.\n","date":1577875516,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577875516,"objectID":"d0bf380af6c626abbbf82a71ba56debb","permalink":"https://afeurtey.github.io/project/genomic_architecture/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T11:45:16+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/genomic_architecture/","section":"project","summary":"Using several fully assembled *Zymoseptoria* genomes, we describe here a high level of conservation in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic composition and structure across the genus *Zymoseptoria*, despite previous reports of high genomic plasticity in *Z. tritici*.

Inoculation experiments suggested plant or fungal local adaptation depending on the populations. These findings indicate that the pathogen has remained isolated in the same fragmented southern refugia as its host plant during the last glaciation, and that little long-distance dispersal has occurred since the recolonization of Europe in neither the plant nor the pathogen, despite their known ability to travel across continents.
