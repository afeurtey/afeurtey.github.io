      <description>This is an ongoing project and is described here only for information. The figures are from talks I have made and they are likely to change as this project evolves and until it gets published officially.
 Human activity has a tremendous impact on the evolutionary trajectories of many species worldwide. Global trade of agricultural goods contributes to the dispersal of domesticated species but also of their pathogens, reshaping species distributions to include new environments and climates.</description>

      <title>Genomic and epigenomic architecture of a plant pathogen</title>

      <description>Using several fully assembled &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria&lt;/em&gt; genomes, we describe here a high level of conservation in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic composition and structure across the genus &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria&lt;/em&gt;, despite previous reports of high genomic plasticity in &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;. The compartmentalized genome allows the maintenance of a functional core genome co-occurring with a highly variable accessory genome.</description>

      <description>During my Master&amp;rsquo;s and PhD projects, in Tatiana Giraudâ€™s group, I studied the role of inter-specific hybridisations in the evolutionary history of apple trees.</description>

      <title>Strong Phylogeographic costructure between the anther-smut fungus and its white campion host</title>

      <description>We demonstrated a significant and particularly strong level of host-pathogen costructure between the anther-smut pathogen Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae and its host plant Silene latifolia. his, together with the inoculation results, suggests that coevolutionary and competitive processes are involved in the evolution of these two species.</description>
