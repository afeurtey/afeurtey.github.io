      <title>Using deep learning to unveil the language of fungal DNA</title>

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afeurtey.github.io/images/NN_00_Main_question.png&#34; alt=&#34;Main question motivating my first deep learning project&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, biology can be thought of as an information processing system. This system transfers information from one generation to the next imperfectly but while maintaining its core structure and functionality. Taken down to its core elements, biology can thus be conceptualised in an information science framework. Furthermore, biological information is transferred in an organized manner, using common patterns of only four letters to form a complex language. Deciphering this genetic grammar is still one of the biggest challenges in biology today. Some DNA grammar elements exhibit near-universality across the tree of life, such as the codon &amp;ldquo;ATG&amp;rdquo; (encoding a methionine) to mark the start signal of a gene in most organisms. However, while such common signals as start/stop codons exist, many evolutionary lineages have adopted specific language elements, contributing to the diversification and adaptation of organisms. Such specificities vary in how evolutionary recent they are and thus how clade-specific they appear. Although coding sequence exhibit such patterns (such as with codon optimization for example), this is particularly true in the non-coding parts of the genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last years, new sequencing technologies have promoted the production of a deluge of new -omics data, allowing for tremendous progress in various fields such as genomics, transcriptomics or epigenomics. However, until recently finding methods to synthesize the information contained within such large amounts of data has been near impossible. I propose to take advantage of the groundbreaking advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to mine the huge amount of available -omics data and provide new insights into old standing biological questions. In particular, I want to apply the latest development in Deep Learning (DL) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to investigate the universality and specificities of the genetic language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a first step toward answering these questions, I tested whether nucleotides can be successfully predicted in fungal genomes with a neural network. I used a simple convolution neural network (CNN), including 25 layers and previously developed to do prediction on &lt;em&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/songlab-cal/gpn/tree/main&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Gonzalo et al.&lt;/a&gt;. Initial tests showed that the CNN trained on Brassicales genomes was unable to predict fungal sequences, so I trained the model again using 25 genomes of Pezizomycotina species, a clade representing a large part of the fungal diversity but excluding budding yeasts. The model trains following the logic of a masked language model and learns to predict each nucleotide identity based on the sequence context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/NN_01_Training_data.png&#34; alt=&#34;Training data&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original CNN was trained on several Brassicales including on &lt;em&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/em&gt; and the predictions were done on the same species (specifically on an unseen chromosome). My goal of using deep learning to learn the DNA language of fungi requires that the knowledge learned on a species ensemble be transferable to other related species. Consequently, I chose to test the model on 9 Pezizomycotina which were never seen during the training of the model. The prediction quality was generally similar between sequences from the seen and unseen species, indicating that the model successfully learned transferable patterns from the initial genomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In neural networks, embeddings are the learned representations of the processed inputs (here, corresponding to DNA sequences) and they should map similar objects close to each other in the embedding space. If the trained CNN has successfully learned the underlying structure of the DNA sequence as suggested by the comparable results between seen and unseen species, the embedding vectors should reflect the known origin of the sequences (i.e. CDS or non-CDS for example). We analysed the embeddings for 100bp sequences using a dimensionality reduction method (UMAP) and indeed showed that sequences from CDS, intronic sequences and repeats were clustering together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/NN_02_Embeddings.png&#34; alt=&#34;UMAP embeddings&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each position, the model can output probabilities for each possible base (A, T, C, G). Based on these probabilities we can compute a prediction score that correspond to the probability of the correct base divided by the average of the prediction for the three other bases. Represented along a sequence in the genome this score reveals which positions are easy to predict (highly negative). In a random gene example from &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria tritici&lt;/em&gt; (see panel A of the figure below), we observe that the start and stop codon are predicted correctly with a very high probability. Other easily predicted positions include slicing sites at intron/exon borders. This is confirmed by the values observed across the sequences of 849 genes (panel B).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/NN_03_Prediction_in_gene.png&#34; alt=&#34;Nucleotide predictions&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together these results indicate that a simple CNN is able to successfully learn the basics syntax elements of the fungal DNA language. These preliminary results provide hint that even such a simple model could be used to predict genes in newly sequenced non-model species, for example, and suggest that more complex syntax elements could be uncovered such as promoter sequences could be identified in fungal genomes using deep learning. Future directions of research also include classifying repeat elements as preliminary results suggest that sequences belonging to the same TE families cluster together in the embedding space.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Global spread and adaptation of a major crop pathogen</title>
      <link>https://afeurtey.github.io/project/thousand_zt_genomes/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://afeurtey.github.io/project/thousand_zt_genomes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has been published in Nature Communications in February 2023 and can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36674-y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can find a very short summary of our main findings below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human activity has a tremendous impact on the evolutionary trajectories of many species worldwide. Global trade of agricultural goods contributes to the dispersal of domesticated species but also of their pathogens, reshaping species distributions to include new environments and climates. In the agricultural context, humans partially control the evolution of crop species as well as some environmental variables, thus imposing selective pressure on crop pathogens. Understanding how pathogens surmount control strategies and cope with new climates is crucial to predicting the future impact of crop pathogens in a changing world.
&lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria tritici&lt;/em&gt; is a major bread and durum wheat pathogen, and causes significant damage in wheat cultivation. It was previously discovered that the center-of-origin of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt; is the Middle-East, where its sister species are infecting wild grasses. It was also found that the speciation of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt; happened at the same time as the domestication of its host. &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt; is now reported in most wheat-growing regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using more than a thousand isolates of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;, we assembled the largest-to-date number of genomes from a fungal plant pathogen species in order to retrace worldwide invasion routes of this species and ongoing genetic exchange among major wheat-growing regions. We identified eleven genetic clusters (see image below), and an early split between the populations of the Middle-East/Africa and the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afeurtey.github.io/images/1000_Zt_Pop_str.png&#34; alt=&#34;Map of the world displaying the 11 genetic clusters and population tree&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also show that the out-of-the-Middle-East migration accompanied by increased activity of transposable elements, probably due to weakened genomic defenses against transposable elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afeurtey.github.io/images/1000_Zt_TE_content.png&#34; alt=&#34;Transposable elements content per isolate for all 11 genetic clusters&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By reconstructing the evolutionary history of the species, we uncovered its impact on adaptive genetic variation and on the evolution of the pathogen genome. Finally, we identify standing variation for adaptation to new climates encountered during the global spread. See below an example of such an analysis for two of the thirteen variables we used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work shows how large population genomic panels enable deep insights into the evolutionary trajectory of a major crop pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genomic and epigenomic architecture of a plant pathogen</title>
      <link>https://afeurtey.github.io/project/genomic_architecture/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 11:45:16 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://afeurtey.github.io/project/genomic_architecture/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-06871-w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Link to the publication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antagonistic co-evolution can drive rapid adaptation in pathogens and shape genome architecture. Comparative genome analyses of several fungal pathogens revealed highly variable genomes, for many species characterized by specific repeat-rich genome compartments with exceptionally high sequence variability. Dynamic genome structure may enable fast adaptation to host genetics. The wheat pathogen &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria tritici&lt;/em&gt; with its highly variable genome, has emerged as a model organism to study genome evolution of plant pathogens. Here, we compared genomes of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt; isolates and of sister species infecting wild grasses to address the evolution of genome composition and structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using long-read technology, we sequenced and assembled genomes of &lt;em&gt;Z. ardabiliae&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Z. brevis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Z. pseudotritici&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Z. passerinii&lt;/em&gt;, together with two isolates of &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;. We report a high extent of genome collinearity among &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria&lt;/em&gt; species and high conservation of genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic signatures of compartmentalization (see image below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afeurtey.github.io/images/Genome_compartment_circos.png&#34; alt=&#34;Circos plots from Z.tritici and Z.pseudotritici, showing compartmentalization at the genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic levels&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identify high gene content variability both within and between species. In addition, such variability is mainly limited to the accessory chromosomes and accessory compartments. Despite strong host specificity and non-overlapping host-range between species, predicted effectors are mainly shared among &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria&lt;/em&gt; species, yet exhibiting a high level of presence-absence polymorphism within &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;. Using in planta transcriptomic data from &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;, we suggest different roles for the shared orthologs and for the accessory genes during infection of their hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite previous reports of high genomic plasticity in &lt;em&gt;Z. tritici&lt;/em&gt;, we describe here a high level of conservation in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic composition and structure across the genus &lt;em&gt;Zymoseptoria&lt;/em&gt;. The compartmentalized genome allows the maintenance of a functional core genome co-occurring with a highly variable accessory genome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crop-to-wild gene flow in apple trees</title>
      <link>https://afeurtey.github.io/project/apple_tree_crop_wild/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2016 11:45:16 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://afeurtey.github.io/project/apple_tree_crop_wild/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my PhD in Tatiana Giraud’s group, I studied the role of inter-specific hybridisations in the evolutionary history of apple trees. I investigated the effect of crop-to-wild gene flow on the conservation of two wild apple tree species:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the European wild apple tree, &lt;em&gt;Malus sylvestris&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Asian wild apple tree, &lt;em&gt;Malus sieversii&lt;/em&gt;, which grows in the Tian Shan mountain forests and is the ancestor of the cultivated apple tree, &lt;em&gt;Malus domestica&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crop-to-wild inter-specific gene flow can be observed in the European wild apple tree, correlated with anthropic activities and threatening the genetic integrity of the wild tree populations, since hybrids do not show any detectable reduction in fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote or participated in several publications around this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12250&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Anthropogenic and natural drivers of gene flow in a temperate wild fruit tree: a basis for conservation and breeding programs in apples&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12441&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Crop-to-wild gene flow and its fitness consequences for a wild fruit tree: Towards a comprehensive conservation strategy of the wild apple in Europe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15677&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Threat to Asian wild apple trees posed by gene flow from domesticated apple trees and their “pestified” pathogens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Strong Phylogeographic costructure between the anther-smut fungus and its white campion host</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://afeurtey.github.io/images/Silene_Microbotryum_costr.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pretty plots showing the costructure between the plant and its pathogen&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the link to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14125&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt; on this topic. We also were very honored to have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.14203&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; written about this paper by Daniel Croll and Anna-Liisa Laine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While congruence between host and pathogen phylogenies has been extensively investigated, the congruence between host and pathogen genetic structures at the within-species level has received little attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using an unprecedented and comprehensive collection of associated plant-pathogen samples, we investigated the degree of congruence between the genetic structures across Europe of two evolutionary and ecological model organisms, the anther-smut pathogen &lt;em&gt;Microbotryum lychnidis-dioicae&lt;/em&gt; and its host plant &lt;em&gt;Silene latifolia&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We demonstrated a significant and particularly strong level of host-pathogen costructure, with three main genetic clusters displaying highly similar spatial ranges in Western, Eastern Europe, and Italy, respectively. Correcting for the geographical component of genetic variation, significant correlations were still found between the genetic distances among the anther-smut populations paired with its host. Inoculation experiments suggested plant or fungal local adaptation depending on the populations.
These findings indicate that the pathogen has remained isolated in the same fragmented southern refugia as its host plant during the last glaciation, and that little long-distance dispersal has occurred since the recolonization of Europe in neither the plant nor the pathogen, despite their known ability to travel across continents. This, together with the inoculation results, suggests that coevolutionary and competitive processes may be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
